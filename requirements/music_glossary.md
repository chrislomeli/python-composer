## 🎚️ Effect / Performance Terms

| Term | Layman’s Explanation | How It Relates to MIDI |
|------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Glissando** | Fast slide through all pitches between two notes. | MIDI approximates this using pitch bend ramps or many small notes. Not a built-in message. |
| **Portamento** | Smooth, continuous glide between notes. | Many synths have a “portamento”/“glide” setting controlled via CC or SysEx. Not defined by MIDI itself. |
| **Legato** | Notes connect with no gaps; smooth transitions. | Achieved by overlapping MIDI notes. Some instruments detect overlaps and trigger legato articulations. |
| **Shimmer** | Sparkly, high-octave reverb effect. | Pure audio effect — MIDI cannot create it. MIDI can only switch patches or adjust effect parameters if exposed via CC. |
| **Vibrato** | Slight, rapid pitch variation. | Often controlled by **Mod Wheel (CC1)** or aftertouch, which adjusts LFO depth. |
| **Tremolo** | Rapid variation in volume. | Can be created by sending volume CC changes or letting the synth apply a volume LFO. |
| **Staccato** | Very short, separated notes. | Created by shortening note lengths or selecting a staccato articulation via keyswitch/CC. |
| **Accent** | Emphasized/louder note. | Typically controlled entirely by **velocity**. |
| **Sforzando (sfz)** | Sudden, strong accent at note start. | Done with very high velocity or specific articulations. |
| **Arpeggio** | A chord’s notes played in sequence rather than together. | Represented directly as individual MIDI notes or generated by an arpeggiator. |
| **Dynamics** | Variation in loudness (soft → loud). | MIDI uses **velocity**, **CC7 (Volume)**, **CC11 (Expression)**, and sometimes CC1 to shape dynamics. |

## 🎼 Composition Terms

| Term | Layman’s Explanation | How It Relates to MIDI |
|------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Movement** | Large, self-contained section (like a chapter). | MIDI does not encode movements; this is handled by DAW arrangement. |
| **Motif** | Short recurring musical idea. | A repeating MIDI pattern or clip. |
| **Phrase** | A musical “sentence.” | Represented as grouped MIDI notes with natural boundaries. |
| **Theme** | A longer, central musical idea. | The main MIDI melody or chord progression. |
| **Harmony** | Notes played together forming chords. | Directly represented as simultaneous MIDI note-on events. |
| **Melody** | The main tune. | Implemented as sequential MIDI notes. |
| **Counterpoint** | Multiple melodies together. | Multiple MIDI tracks or simultaneous independent voices. |
| **Ostinato** | A repeating pattern. | A looping MIDI clip or repeated rhythmic figure. |
| **Cadence** | Musical punctuation/ending. | Realized through chord progressions in MIDI note data. |
| **Chord Progression** | Sequence of chords. | Directly encoded as grouped MIDI notes per chord. |
| **Arrangement** | Assignment of musical ideas to instruments. | Controlled via tracks, MIDI channels, and instrument patches. |
| **Texture** | Thickness or thinness of musical layers. | Achieved via track density and instrumentation choices. |
| **Form** | High-level structure (verse/chorus, AABA). | Implemented as MIDI clip arrangement across a timeline. |

## 🎧 MIDI-Specific Sound Design Concepts

| Term | Layman’s Explanation | How It Relates to MIDI |
|------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Velocity** | How hard a note is played. | Directly encoded in MIDI; affects loudness/brightness. |
| **Aftertouch** | Pressure after a key is pressed. | Sends continuous modulation for vibrato, brightness, etc. |
| **CC (Control Change)** | Adjustable parameters in MIDI. | Controls volume, expression, modulation, filters, etc. |
| **Modulation (CC1)** | Broad expressive control. | Usually mapped to vibrato or brightness. |
| **Expression (CC11)** | Fine volume shaping. | Secondary volume control that doesn’t override the main volume (CC7). |
| **Articulation** | Playing style (staccato/legato/etc.). | Triggered via keyswitch notes, CCs, or program changes. |
| **Envelope / ADSR** | Attack, decay, sustain, release shape. | MIDI cannot define ADSR; it only triggers envelopes (note-on) or adjusts them if synth exposes CC/NRPN/SysEx. |
| **LFO** | Slow modulation source for vibrato, tremolo, etc. | MIDI cannot define LFO shapes/rates; it can only change their depth or speed through CC. |
| **Pitch Bend** | Smooth pitch adjustments. | Native MIDI message for continuous pitch shifting. |

## 🧠 Velocity 

| Term           | Layman’s Explanation | Roughly in MIDI  |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **ppp**        | softest              | velocity=16      |
| **pp**         | softer               | velocity=32      |
| **p**          | soft                 | velocity=48      |
| **P**          | soft +               | velocity=64      |
| **F**          | softest high         | velocity=80      |
| **f**          | high                 | velocity=96      |
| **ff**         | very high            | velocity=112     |
| **fff**        | blasting             | velocity=127     |
